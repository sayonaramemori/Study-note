### Chepter 1
#### 1.map and function
- $x1\neq x2$,*thier mapped value* $f(x1)\neq f(x2)$,*we define this case as single map*
	1. only the function in this condition,exist its $f^{-1}(x)$

- *for a function,if its $f^{-1}(x)$ exist, then $y=f(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$ is a monotone function(increasing or decresing)*
	1. conversely, if a function is monotone function, it's not certainly exists its $f^{-1}(x)$
>define a function,its domain defination is (-l,l),try to prove that odd fuction $g(x)$ and even function $h(x)$ certainly exist to make this formula true<br>$f(x)=g(x)+h(x)$  
#### 2.limit of sequence

#### 3.limit of function
- $\epsilon - \delta$
